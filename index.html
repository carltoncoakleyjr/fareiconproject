<article class="story">
	<p>The subway is a blur of footsteps, taps, and hurried sighs as millions of New Yorkers rush through turnstiles each day. Yet beneath that daily rush, money quitely slips away. A game of cat and mouse between fare evaders and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is costing the nation's transit system hundreds of millions. A financial strain that poses a challenege for every train, platform, and rider.</p>

	<p>MTA officals warns that persistent fare evasion could threaten service reliablity, drive future fare hikes, and deepen frustraion with a system already criticized for delays, overcrowding, and safety concerns.</p>

			<p>The numbers tell the story. In 2024, the MTA lost nearly $1 billion to fare evasion, according to the 
				<a href="https://cbcny.org/research/no-fare" target="_blank">Citizen Budget Commission</a>. So far this year, losses hover near $900 million, a modest sign of progress after months of stepped-up enforcment and added redesigns. Those missing fare shows up elsewhere, in stalled trains, broken signals, and longer waits on crowded platforms.</p>

	<p>In efforts to slow down fare beaters, the agency has implemented new tactics. Over
		<a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-announces-progress-reducing-subway-fare-evasion" target="_blank">1,400 turnstiles</a> have been modified due to "back-cocking", closing that loophole by nearly 80% at upgraded stations. 
		<a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mta-fare-evasion-spikes/6113454/" target="_blank">Rubber fins and spiked shields</a> now stand guard at major hubs, including Times Square, Atlantic Ave Barclays Center, and Fulton Street, sending a visible arning that avoidance to pay foe services has consequences. Station agents now also monitor more than 200 high-risk stops, cutting evasion by 30%.</p>

		<p>On buses, <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-updates-new-yorkers-mtas-efforts-combat-fare-evasion" target="_blank">EAGLE teams</a> patrol routes, issuing fines and urging riders to pay. Togther, these measures have helped recover millions once lost to unpaid fares.</p>

		<p>For New Yorkers though, vexation lingers. Why keep paying nearly $3 when delays and track breakdowns have become part of their cdaily commute? The fare will rise from $2.90 to $3 starting January 2026.</p>

		<p>N'asisha Grant, a rider waiting on a Brooklyn-bound platform, sighed after a 23-minute delay. "We're paying for a service that seems to always have issues. It's ridiculous, and yet they expect us to pay," she said as another train rumbled past. For passenagers like her, every fare feels less like a payment and more like a test of faith in a system they rely on.</p>

		<p class="ending">As riders tap and go with their phones or OMNY cards, many gripe about rising costs, but for the MTA, every unpaid fare is another set back and hole within its budget.</p>
